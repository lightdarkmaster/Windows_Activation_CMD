# Warning about the Script.sh
Replace your_command_here with the command you want to run in the Command Prompt.

Save this script with a .bat extension (e.g., run_command.bat) and double-click it to execute the script. It will open a Command Prompt window and run the specified command. The /k flag keeps the Command Prompt window open after executing the command so that you can see the results.

Please be cautious when running batch scripts, especially if they contain commands that modify your system or files.
